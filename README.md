# MEMORY MANAGER - First Fit

The goal of this project is to implement the First Fit Memory Manager Algorithm. With this algorithm, each process is allocated into the first available hole of memory.

## Getting Started

Launch the index.html document to open the simulator.

### Prerequisites

--Must have access to an internet browser.
	*Google Chrome is recommended*


## Running the tests

1. Select which algorithm you would like to test from the dropdown menu 
	**NOTE: This version only allows First Fit**
2. From the next dropdown menu, select a process to be allocated to memory. (Range: P1 --> P10)
3. Assign a size to the selected process(K) in the corresponding input field.
	**NOTE: If a random size is desired, click the 'RANDOMIZE SIZE' button. Random sizes are assigned a value between 1 and 350 (inclusive)**
4. Once the process is assigned a size, click the '+' button to add to memory.
5. You will notice the process added to the simulation on the left-hand side. *To remove this process from memory, click the '-' button.*
6. To view the size of each process in memory, click on the desired process in the simulation.
7. If you wish to reset the page to its original state, click the 'START OVER' button.
